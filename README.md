Seal World is a website built with HTML5 and CSS3 that provides information about the world of seals in a visual and interactive way. The page features a background video in the main section, informative sections with images, a species gallery, and fun facts, all within a responsive design. The project was created as an exercise in semantic structure, media integration, content organization, and CSS styling.
